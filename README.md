# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Overview
To analyze the statistical risk associated with credit loans, I worked with various supervised machine learning systems. In doing so, I evaluted the performance of these machine learning models that reduce bias, on whether they could predict credit risk. This was done hand-in-hand with LendingClub, a lending service that requested an analysis and assessment on credit card risk. 

As credit risk at its core is an unbalanced classification problem, varying techniques that will be outlined below, were used to train and evaluate the models, to determine which algorithm performed best. 

## Results
Below you will find an analysis on the 6 machine learning models used.
